## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- \[Linux\] OpenSSL 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.1.0, or 1.1.1 with headers

## üîâ Announcement

This announcement is made due to the [disharmony event of Mirai](https://github.com/mamoe/mirai/issues/850).

  - This project has been developed for the hobby of developers and contributors. So,
    1. we might add/change some features or even remove some features just because we are interested in making these changes
    2. and posting any offensive speech/content/behavior that expresses the opposition to the points above will result in a **BAN FOREVER**
  - The fact that this project is open-sourced does not mean that the developer is obliged to provide you any services.
  - Your speech should not be offensive.
  - Read the [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) before you ask any questions.
  - If necessary, the developer reserves the right to stop any technical support for you.
  - If necessary, the developer reserves the right of **BANNING** you for any reason.
  - We will try **our best** to notify in beforehand about the modification/removal of the internal implementation of the program, but we cannot guarantee anything.
  - We will try **our best** to make updating the program easier (for example, no need to change anything other than executable binary) or clearly notify other changes needed. But this is not guaranteed either.

If you feel discomfort about the announcement above, you should consider stopping using this project.
